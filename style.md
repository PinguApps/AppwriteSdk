Here are the refined and categorized guidelines:

1. Naming Conventions:
   - Use PascalCase for public properties, methods, and class names.
   - Use camelCase for method parameters.
   - Follow a consistent naming convention for test methods: [MethodName]_Should[ExpectedBehavior]_When[Condition].

2. Code Structure:
   - Organize code into separate files and folders for different functionalities (e.g., Clients, Handlers, Requests, Responses).
   - Use inheritance and interfaces for consistent API structure.
   - Implement both client and server SDKs when adding new endpoints.
   - Use dependency injection for service configuration.
   - Utilize records for immutable data types where appropriate.

3. Documentation:
   - Add XML documentation comments for all public methods and classes.
   - Include links to official documentation in comments where relevant.
   - Keep the README updated with current implementation status and progress.

4. Error Handling:
   - Implement consistent error handling and response formatting across the codebase.
   - Use try-catch blocks for exception handling in client methods.
   - Implement proper null checks and handling throughout the codebase.

5. Performance:
   - Use async/await pattern for asynchronous operations.
   - Utilize System.Text.Json for JSON serialization and deserialization.

6. Security:
   - Implement OAuth2 authentication following specific guidelines.

7. Testing and Quality Assurance:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for new features and changes, covering various scenarios including edge cases.
   - Maintain 100% code coverage for all packages.
   - Organize tests into Arrange, Act, and Assert sections.
   - Perform a self-review before requesting a code review from others.

8. Version Control and Dependency Management:
   - Use a checklist in pull requests to ensure quality standards.
   - Keep dependencies up-to-date, regularly updating to the latest minor versions.
   - Use specific digest versions or commit hashes for GitHub Actions to ensure reproducibility and security.

9. Code Style and Best Practices:
   - Use FluentValidation for request object validation.
   - Maintain consistent indentation and formatting throughout the codebase.
   - Follow clean code principles with descriptive variable names and small, focused methods.
   - Use constants for repeated values (like error messages) to promote maintainability.

10. API Design:
    - Use interface-based design (e.g., IAccountClient).
    - Maintain consistent method signatures with uniform parameter naming across similar methods.
    - Implement proper API versioning to maintain compatibility.
